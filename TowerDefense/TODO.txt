Problems!:

The compiler still doesnt like compiling in java 6 (maybe fix that) the crashfix has been found, (previously it was whining about wrong image docs,
now its fixed) the new error is the clientversion (jre or was it jme) well thats to be fixed by doing:
Project->Properties->Java->Compiler->enable "project specific settings" and then set "Java Compliance Level" to 1.4. 
Lets hope it works at your side too now!
